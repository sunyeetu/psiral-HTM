Game starts with the 4 players (wizards) taking positions in the 4 corners of the map. 
The goal is to reach the fountain of fountain of endless energy in the center of the map. 
On each turn, players can choose whether to throw the dice of *chance* or cast a *spell*. 
Wizards move only forward on predefined spiral-alike paths. Paths can be seen on each player's move.

## Chance

Throw the dice and let *Chance* determines what happens next.

3    | Numb   | Skip 1 turn
4    | Mana   | Mana +1

## Spells & Mana

All players start with 10 points of mana. Mana does **not** get replenished over time! 
The only way to replenish mana is to get 4 or 5 when throwing the dice.

is a spell available only to the particular wizard.

## Story

It is very rare for humans to achieve the status of a higher being. This requires absolute devotion to the ethereal. To the very fabrics that space constitutes of. Those who learn how to thread these fabrics, twist them and control them, will then get elevated closer to the higher presence.
